  Create and implement plain language guidelines for all directory content.
  Target 8th grade reading level. Plain language benefits everyone, not just
  people with cognitive disabilities - improves comprehension, reduces bounce
  rate, and supports non-native speakers.

  Context: Plain language is critical for cognitive accessibility (ADHD,
  learning disabilities, intellectual disabilities) and benefits all users.
  Improves SEO and user satisfaction.

  - Create plain language writing guidelines
  - Audit existing content
  - Rewrite content to meet guidelines
  - Train content creators
  - Document before/after examples

scope:
  - Page headings and titles
  - Body content
  - Button and link text
  - Form labels and instructions
  - Error messages
  - Help text
