title: Migrations and Environment-Specific Seeding
description: >
  Solidify migration and seeding practices:
  - Define a repeatable workflow for Prisma migrations (dev/stage/prod), including safeguards and rollback guidance.
  - Add environment-specific seeds (dev/demo/test) and scripts/Make targets to run them.
  - Document how to reset/refresh DB locally and in CI; ensure seeds don’t pollute prod.
