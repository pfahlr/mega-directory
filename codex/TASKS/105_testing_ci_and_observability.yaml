title: Testing, CI, and Observability
description: >
  Stand up repeatable testing and monitoring to cover the MVP surface:
  - Establish a CI pipeline (lint, typecheck, unit/integration tests for API, web, admin, crawler) with fixtures for DB/Redis.
  - Add health checks and structured logging coverage for API/web/admin; expose metrics or logs suitable for monitoring.
  - Expand automated tests to cover directory/listing endpoints, routing middleware, and admin review flows (unit + integration).
  - Document how to run the suite locally (Makefile/script) and ensure CI artifacts (coverage reports) are generated.
