title: OpenAPI & Validation Parity
description: >
  Bring API docs and validators up to date with the current Prisma schema and admin/public behaviors:
  - Audit OpenAPI docs to include directory/listing fields (locationAgnostic, featuredLimit, introMarkdown, description/summary) and correct status enums (ACTIVE vs PUBLISHED).
  - Ensure Zod validation schemas, route validators, and Prisma DTOs stay in sync; add tests that fail when schema/docs diverge.
  - Regenerate/serve Swagger UI with updated schemas and add a contract test that validates sample payloads against OpenAPI.
