  Synthesize findings from Tasks 76-79 (SEO and accessibility research) to
  create a comprehensive implementation plan for enhancing the 2 main public-
  facing directory templates.

  This task will analyze all research, identify overlapping requirements,
  prioritize enhancements, and generate specific implementation tasks (81-8x)

  accessibility will create competitive advantage and serve the widest
  possible audience.
