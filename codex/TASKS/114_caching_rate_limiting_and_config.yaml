title: Caching, Rate Limiting, and Config Wiring
description: >
  Wire Redis caching and rate limiting with observable config:
  - Ensure cache init uses env-configured Redis and is exercised for directory/listing endpoints with cache invalidation hooks.
  - Verify rate limiting is enabled with sensible defaults and exposed metrics/logs.
  - Add healthcheck/diagnostics endpoints or logs to confirm cache/limit status, and tests that verify caching behavior and limits.
