title: Meta, Schema, and Canonical URL Coverage
description: >
  Ensure directory and listing pages emit complete SEO/OG/JSON-LD metadata from stored configuration:
  - Render canonical URLs, meta title/description/keywords, og:image, and Twitter cards from directory config for all directory routes (including dynamic slugs).
  - Add JSON-LD (CollectionPage/ItemList + LocalBusiness where applicable) driven by directory/listing data with fallbacks.
  - Verify subdomain/subdirectory canonical handling matches routing config.
  - Provide tests or snapshots that validate meta/schema output for at least one active directory and one with featured listings.
