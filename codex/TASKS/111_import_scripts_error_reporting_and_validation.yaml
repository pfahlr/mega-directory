description: >
  Harden crawler/text import pipelines with validation and actionable errors:
  - Enforce targets/config schema validation with clear errors before runs.
  - Improve text_import and crawler post-processing to surface per-record failures, retries, and skipped items.
  - Add integration tests for text_import and crawler runs against stubbed endpoints, including malformed input cases.
  - Document runbook and troubleshooting for import failures.
