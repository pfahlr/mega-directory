title: Generate Admin Interface for Reviewing Imported JSON Listing Data
description: >
- Build interface for admin to review listings parsed from JSON imports.
- Show extracted data and allow edit/approve/deactivate workflows before insertion.
- each listing should be presented as a set of populated and editable form elements along with two checkboxes saved (checked by default) and active (checked by default). If the "saved" box is unchecked upon form submission, then the listing will not be stored in the database (or deleted if already stored). If the "active" box is unchecked upon form submission the listing will be marked inactive. A submit/save button should appear at the top and bottom of the page.
- each page should display 10 listings.
- this admin form should be used also for editing existing listings.
- additional information regarding entire development project this task is part of can be referenced in `codex/TASKS/codex_phase_1b_2.yaml`
