description: >
  Research and document WCAG accessibility requirements for diverse disability
  categories including: age-related impairments, multiple disabilities, health
  conditions, changing abilities, temporary impairments, situational limitations,
  cognitive disabilities, auditory disabilities, and speech disabilities.

  Goal: Ensure our directory templates are accessible to the widest possible
  audience, accounting for intersectional disabilities and varied use cases.

  Context: The mega-directory has 2 main public templates used for 99% of pages.
  Comprehensive accessibility will serve diverse users and create competitive
  advantage.
