title: Accessibility and Contrast Hardening
description: >
  Implement the outstanding WCAG tasks for directory/admin UIs:
  - Add skip links, focus management, ARIA landmarks/roles, keyboard navigation parity, and large click targets across public and admin pages.
  - Enforce WCAG AA color contrast (and optional high-contrast mode toggle), with alt-text standards and plain-language cues.
  - Improve map accessibility (keyboard focus, announcements, reduced motion) and ensure components degrade gracefully without JS.
  - Add automated accessibility checks (axe/vitest or pa11y) for key pages: home, directory page with map, admin listings table.
