title: Research WCAG Accessibility for Limited Motor/Mobility Users
priority: 🟡 Important
impact: High
effort: Low
dependencies: []

description: >
  Research and document WCAG accessibility requirements and best practices
  specifically for people with limited motor skills, mobility impairments,
  and physical disabilities.

  Goal: Implement navigation by single button click (or single-switch access),
  ensure logical tab order, and research what people with motor impairments
  expect from web interfaces to make our directory easier to navigate than
  search engines.

  Context: The mega-directory has 2 main public templates used for 99% of pages.
  Perfect accessibility for motor-impaired users will create a significant
  competitive advantage.

keyboard_navigation_best_practices:

  fundamental_requirements:
    tab_navigation:
      - Tab moves forward through interactive elements
      - Shift+Tab moves backward
      - Tab order follows visual order (left-to-right, top-to-bottom)
      - Tab order is logical and predictable
      - No keyboard traps (can always escape)
      - Skip links allow bypassing repetitive content
      - All interactive elements are in tab order
      - Decorative/non-interactive elements not in tab order

    arrow_key_navigation:
      - Arrow keys for composite widgets (menus, tabs, radio groups)
      - Up/Down for vertical navigation
      - Left/Right for horizontal navigation
      - Home/End for first/last items
      - Page Up/Page Down for pagination
      - Use roving tabindex for widget components

    activation:
      - Enter activates buttons and links
      - Space activates buttons and checkboxes
      - Space scrolls page (if not in widget)
      - Enter submits forms
      - Escape closes dialogs/menus
      - Consistent behavior across site

    focus_management:
      - Focus moves logically through content
      - Opening dialog moves focus to dialog
      - Closing dialog returns focus to trigger
      - Deleting item moves focus to next item
      - Loading content doesn't lose focus
      - Focus visible at all times

  keyboard_shortcuts:
    considerations:
      - Document all keyboard shortcuts
      - Provide way to disable or customize
      - Don't override browser/AT shortcuts
      - Use modifier keys (Ctrl/Alt) to avoid conflicts
      - Consider international keyboard layouts
      - Provide shortcut help (? or Shift+/)

    common_shortcuts:
      - / : Focus search
      - ? : Show keyboard shortcuts help
      - Esc : Close dialog/menu
      - Ctrl+Home : Jump to top
      - Ctrl+End : Jump to bottom

  skip_links:
    purpose: Allow bypassing repetitive navigation
    implementation:
      - First focusable element on page
      - Visible on focus (can be hidden otherwise)
      - Multiple skip links if needed:
        - Skip to main content
        - Skip to search
        - Skip to footer
      - Internal anchor links (#main-content)
      - Clear, descriptive text

single_switch_access:

  what_is_switch_access:
    description: >
      Single-switch access allows users with severe motor impairments to
      interact with computers using one or two switches. The interface
      automatically scans through interactive elements, and the user
      activates their switch when the desired element is highlighted.

  switch_device_types:
    - Button switches (hand, foot, head)
    - Sip-and-puff switches (breath control)
    - Eye-blink switches
    - Sound-activated switches
    - Squeeze switches
    - Proximity switches

  how_switch_scanning_works:
    automatic_scanning:
      - Interface highlights elements sequentially
      - User activates switch when desired element highlighted
      - Scanning speed is adjustable
      - Two-switch mode: one to advance, one to select
      - One-switch mode: auto-advances, user selects

    scan_patterns:
      - Linear: scan each element in order
      - Row-column: scan rows, then columns
      - Grouped: scan groups, then items within group

  requirements_for_switch_compatibility:
    - Standard keyboard navigation must work perfectly
    - Logical, consistent tab order
    - All interactive elements keyboard-accessible
    - No keyboard traps
    - Clear focus indicators
    - Simple, predictable interactions
    - Undo functionality
    - No time limits (or adjustable)
    - Large click targets

voice_control_compatibility:

  voice_control_systems:
    - Dragon NaturallySpeaking (Windows)
    - Voice Control (iOS/macOS)
    - Voice Access (Android)
    - Windows Speech Recognition
    - Browser voice commands

  how_voice_control_works:
    - Users speak commands to navigate and interact
    - "Click [button name]" to activate buttons
    - "Click [link text]" to follow links
    - "Show numbers" to display number labels
    - "Show grid" for precise positioning

  requirements_for_voice_compatibility:
    - Visible labels that match accessible names
    - Clear, unique button and link text
    - Avoid generic text like "click here"
    - Use buttons for actions, links for navigation
    - Ensure interactive elements have accessible names
    - No label/name mismatches (WCAG 2.5.3)

click_target_sizing:

  wcag_guidelines:
    level_aaa:
      - Minimum target size: 44x44 CSS pixels
      - Exception: Inline links in text
      - Exception: User agent controlled (default controls)
      - Exception: Essential presentation (e.g., maps)

    level_aa_2_2:
      - Minimum target size: 24x24 CSS pixels
      - Same exceptions as AAA

  best_practices:
    recommended_sizes:
      - Buttons: 44x44px minimum, 48x48px better
      - Touch targets on mobile: 48x48px minimum
      - Links in text: Adequate line height (1.5+)
      - Icons: 24x24px minimum visible area
      - Form controls: 44px height minimum

    spacing:
      - 8px minimum spacing between targets
      - 16px spacing preferred
      - Adequate padding within targets
      - Avoid cramped layouts

    implementation:
      - Use padding to increase click area
      - Entire card/row clickable (not just text)
      - Icon buttons should have large click area
      - Ensure spacing in mobile views
      - Test with touch/pointer devices

timing_and_user_control:

  no_time_limits:
    wcag_2_2_1:
      - No time limits on interactions
      - Or: User can turn off time limit
      - Or: User can adjust before encountering
      - Or: User can extend with simple action
      - Or: Time limit > 20 hours

    exceptions:
      - Real-time events (auctions, etc.)
      - Time limit essential
      - Time limit > 20 hours

  pause_stop_hide:
    wcag_2_2_2:
      - Auto-updating content can be paused
      - Auto-scrolling can be stopped
      - Animations can be stopped
      - Blinking content can be hidden

  avoid:
    - Session timeouts without warning
    - Auto-advancing carousels
    - Auto-scrolling content
    - Automatic redirects
    - Animations that can't be stopped

focus_indicators:

  requirements:
    - All interactive elements show focus
    - Focus indicator has 3:1 contrast ratio
    - Focus indicator area is sufficient
    - Custom indicators are clear and visible
    - Don't remove :focus without replacement
    - Consider :focus-visible for mouse/keyboard distinction

  best_practices:
    - High contrast outline or border
    - 2-3px thick outline
    - Offset from element for clarity
    - Consistent across all elements
    - Additional indicator (background color) helpful
    - Test in high contrast mode

  implementation_examples:
    - CSS outline: 2px solid #005fcc
    - Box shadow: 0 0 0 3px rgba(0,95,204,0.5)
    - Background color change
    - Border color change
    - Combination of techniques

directory_specific_considerations:

notes:
  - Keyboard accessibility is foundation for all adaptive technologies
  - Perfect keyboard navigation enables switch access and voice control
  - Large click targets benefit mobile users and motor-impaired users
  - Tab order is critical - test thoroughly
  - Focus indicators must never be removed without replacement
  - Single-switch access is most demanding - if it works, everything works
  - Voice control requires visible text labels that match accessible names
  - Testing with actual users is ideal but not always possible
  - Automated testing can verify tab order and focus indicators
  - Perfect accessibility on 2 templates = perfect on thousands of pages
