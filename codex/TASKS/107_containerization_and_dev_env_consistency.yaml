title: Containerization and Dev Environment Consistency
description: >
  Ensure local and deployable environments match the task specs:
  - Validate and, if needed, fix Dockerfiles for API/web/admin and provide a working docker-compose stack (DB/Redis/api/web/admin) with sane defaults.
  - Add environment bootstrap scripts/Make targets to set required env vars (including ADMIN_API_BASE_URL/PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL) and optional SOPS loading.
  - Document Railway (or equivalent) deploy steps and health checks; add smoke test command to verify the stack after `docker-compose up`.
  - Include basic CI job to build images and run compose-based smoke tests.
