title: Implement WCAG AAA Where Feasible
priority: 🟢 Nice-to-Have
impact: Medium
effort: High
dependencies: [77, 78, 79, 80, 81-96]
phase: Frontend Enhancement - Phase 5 (Enhancements)

description: >
  Implement WCAG 2.2 Level AAA requirements where feasible and practical.
  AAA is aspirational - not all criteria are achievable for all content,
  but many AAA requirements significantly improve accessibility.

  Context: Level AA is the legal requirement, but AAA provides enhanced
  experience for users with disabilities. Focus on achievable AAA criteria
  that benefit users without unreasonable burden.

objectives:
  - Identify feasible AAA criteria
  - Implement high-value AAA enhancements
  - Document AAA compliance level
  - Understand AAA criteria that aren't feasible

scope:
  - Color contrast (7:1 for text)
  - Target size (44x44px)
  - Extended audio descriptions (if video content)
  - Consistent help (if applicable)

implementation_guidelines:

  achievable_aaa_criteria:

    1.4.6_contrast_enhanced:
      requirement: "7:1 contrast for normal text, 4.5:1 for large text"
      feasibility: "High - mainly color palette adjustment"
      example: |
        :root {
          --text-primary: #000000;     /* 21:1 on white */
          --text-secondary: #333333;   /* 12.6:1 on white */
          --link-color: #0051a5;       /* 8.2:1 on white */
        }

    2.4.8_location:
      requirement: "Information about user's location within site"
      feasibility: "High - breadcrumbs already planned"
      implementation: "Already covered by breadcrumb implementation"

    2.5.5_target_size:
      requirement: "Minimum 44x44 CSS pixels for targets"
      feasibility: "High - already planned in Task 87"
      implementation: "Already covered"

    3.2.5_change_on_request:
      requirement: "Changes of context only by user request"
      feasibility: "High - good UX practice anyway"
      implementation: "No auto-redirects, no auto-playing media, no automatic form submission"

    3.3.5_help:
      requirement: "Context-sensitive help available"
      feasibility: "Medium - depends on content"
      example: |
        <!-- Inline help text -->
        <label for="phone">
          Phone number
          <button type="button" aria-label="Help with phone number" class="help-btn">?</button>
        </label>
        <div id="phone-help" class="help-text" hidden>
          Enter phone in format: (555) 123-4567
        </div>

    2.4.10_section_headings:
      requirement: "Section headings to organize content"
      feasibility: "High - good content structure anyway"
      implementation: "Already planned in semantic HTML task"

  difficult_or_inapplicable_aaa_criteria:

    1.2.6_sign_language:
      requirement: "Sign language interpretation for prerecorded audio"
      feasibility: "Low - very expensive, limited video content"
      decision: "Not implementing (directory site has minimal video)"

    1.2.8_media_alternative:
      requirement: "Full text alternative for prerecorded media"
      feasibility: "Medium - depends on video content"
      decision: "Implement if/when video content added"

    1.4.7_low_background_audio:
      requirement: "Audio with little/no background noise"
      feasibility: "N/A - directory site has no audio content"

    2.1.3_keyboard_no_exception:
      requirement: "Keyboard for ALL functionality (no exceptions)"
      feasibility: "High - already goal for AA"
      implementation: "Already covered"

    2.2.3_no_timing:
      requirement: "No time limits"
      feasibility: "High - directory site doesn't need time limits"
      implementation: "Already planned (no session timeouts)"

    2.2.4_interruptions:
      requirement: "Interruptions can be postponed/suppressed"
      feasibility: "High - don't use interruptions anyway"
      implementation: "No modal popups, no chat widgets"

    2.4.9_link_purpose_link_only:
      requirement: "Link purpose clear from link text alone"
      feasibility: "High - good practice"
      implementation: "Use descriptive link text (already planned)"

    3.1.3_unusual_words:
      requirement: "Definitions for unusual words"
      feasibility: "Medium - depends on content"
      decision: "Implement if technical terms used"

    3.1.4_abbreviations:
      requirement: "Expansions for abbreviations"
      feasibility: "Medium - minimal abbreviations used"
      example: |
        <abbr title="Illinois">IL</abbr>

    3.1.5_reading_level:
      requirement: "Lower secondary education level (8th grade)"
      feasibility: "High - already planned in plain language task"
      implementation: "Already covered in Task 90"

  implementation_priority:
    high_priority_aaa:
      - "Enhanced contrast (7:1)"
      - "44x44px targets"
      - "Section headings"
      - "Link purpose from text alone"
      - "Reading level (8th grade)"

    medium_priority_aaa:
      - "Context-sensitive help"
      - "Abbreviation expansions"
      - "No timing"
      - "No interruptions"

    low_priority_or_na:
      - "Sign language interpretation"
      - "Extended audio descriptions"
      - "Low background audio"

success_criteria:
  - High-priority AAA criteria implemented
  - Enhanced contrast (7:1) for most text
  - 44x44px targets everywhere
  - No timing or interruptions
  - Documentation of AAA compliance level

testing_procedures:
  - Test contrast with 7:1 standard
  - Measure target sizes
  - Verify no time limits
  - Test reading level
  - Document AAA compliance

deliverables:
  - AAA compliance documentation
  - List of implemented AAA criteria
  - List of non-applicable AAA criteria
  - Justification for non-implemented criteria

acceptance_criteria:
  - All achievable AAA criteria implemented
  - AAA compliance level documented
  - Rationale for non-implemented criteria documented

estimated_time: 3-5 days
