description: >
  Research and document WCAG accessibility requirements and best practices
  specifically for people with low vision and blindness, focusing on screen
  reader optimization and visual accessibility features.

  Goal: Implement accessibility features that exceed expectations to fill a
  niche for people with low vision, making our directory pages easier to
  navigate than search engines.

  Context: The mega-directory has 2 main public templates used for 99% of pages.
  Perfect accessibility implementation here will benefit thousands of pages and
  create a competitive advantage for users with disabilities.

    examples:
      - Business photo: "Exterior of Main Street Coffee Shop with outdoor seating"
      - Logo: "Main Street Coffee Shop logo"
      - Decorative: alt=""
      - Map marker: "Location marker for 123 Main St"

  - Task 79: WCAG Accessibility for Multiple Categories
  - Task 80: Generate Implementation Plan from Research

notes:
  - Accessibility and SEO often reinforce each other
  - Screen reader optimization benefits voice assistants
  - Semantic HTML improves both accessibility and SEO
  - Focus on practical, testable implementations
  - Aim for WCAG 2.1 Level AA as baseline, AAA where feasible
  - User testing with actual screen reader users is ideal
  - Automated testing catches ~30-40% of issues
  - Manual testing and user testing are essential
  - Perfect accessibility on 2 templates = perfect on thousands of pages
