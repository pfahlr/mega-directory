title: Crawler → API Alignment & Enrichment
description: >
  Close the loop between the Python crawler and the admin/API ingestion pipeline:
  - Finalize JSON/YAML crawler config schema and validation (targets, categories, locations, enrichment flags).
  - Implement address/category assignment and LLM field generation hooks per task specs, with retries and rate limits.
  - Post crawler output to the live admin ingestion endpoint with auth, handling batch size, dedupe, and error reporting.
  - Add unit tests for normalization/enrichment and an end-to-end smoke test that exercises posting to a stub API.
