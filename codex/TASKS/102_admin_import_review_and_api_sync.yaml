title: Admin Import Review & API Sync
description: >
  Replace placeholder listing review data with the real ingestion queue and improve moderation UX:
  - Wire the admin listings table to the admin API (pagination, filters, status toggles) instead of static JSON.
  - Persist moderator edits (name, URLs, notes, summary, description, activation) via batch review endpoint with clear success/failure messaging.
  - Add error handling, empty states, and loading indicators; ensure long/short descriptions are editable and saved.
  - Add integration tests (or contract tests) covering happy path, validation errors, and pagination.
