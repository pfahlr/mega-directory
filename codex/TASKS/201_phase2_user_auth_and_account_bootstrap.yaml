title: "Phase 2: User Auth and Account Bootstrap"
description: >
  Implement user account bootstrapping workflow:
  - On interaction requiring login, auto-generate a user stub (UUID, anonymous username)
  - Present token-based login link with option to set email, username, and password
  - Support login via email (magic link or password if present)
  - Prepare schema for password-less login, with future 2FA extensibility
  - Ensure consistent user session management and backend token handling
